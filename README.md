# Spotify App

This app is not live for now, as it was meant to be an app for me to check my daily, weekly, and monthly artists. This will go live soon!




# Hardest Part Of Project

The hardest part of this project was understanding how the Spotify API worked. Before I jumped into the implementation, I first spent some time understanding the API and its documentation before watching a few videos. After the video process, I began designing the component that I would use to render the information from the API. After countless hours I finished the project!
